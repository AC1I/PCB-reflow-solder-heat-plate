# PCB reflow solder heat plate
This is the first design for a PCB based solder heat plate.

v0.9 has additional temperature sensors to better understand the thermals of the design, but v1.0 will probably work with less sensors.
Electrical safety has been considered in this build, inrush current and power draw are limited to safe values under normal conditions.

Board dimensions are 100 x 100 mm, and almost all parts can be sourced from LCSC.
This repository includes an interactive BOM with annotations and LCSC parts numbers.
